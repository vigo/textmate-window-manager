# TextMate Window Manager

If you are still using [TextMate][1] like me (*in the year of 2014*)
You'll really like it!

## Installation

Just as the common bundle installation.

    cd "~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles"
    git clone https://github.com/vigo/textmate-window-manager.git
    osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'

You'll see the menu appears in **Bundles** section
